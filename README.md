### INCREMENTING COUNTER

Not the ODIN Project and not any other formal project â€“ just one of the '50 Projects in 50 Days' things from another course that I am also following. The idea here is to build something simple, quickly, using simple, essential (and repeatable) techniques in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. I try to do at least one of these a week. Currently I am on no. 15 (out of 50).

This is the first such project I have posted to GitHub. The main reason for this is in order to maintain the 'GitHub Habit'. Not just the Terminal/web knowledge of the nuts-and-bolts commands for the setting up of a new repository, and then maintaining it. There is also the maintaining of an understanding that this is the working method of a coder.
